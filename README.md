Data analytics has helped companies optimize and grow their performance for 
decades. Data analytics and visualization has aided us with several benefits, few of 
them being identifying emerging trends, studying relationships and patterns in data, 
analysis in depth and cherry on top are the insights we draw from these patterns. It 
is requirement of time that we study this concepts in thoroughly for all this benefits 
it provides. This project is all about understanding one such data set of uber from 
New York City and is very component to understand the use of data analytics and 
visualization. It is generated with the help of ‘Python’ programming language using 
libraries such as numpy, seaborn, pandas, matplotlib, missingno . Through projects 
like this, we can gain knowledge of various operations performed in data 
visualization. It will enable us to recognize the patterns in data of this huge 
organization and provides critical insights of untapped information.
